# Serverless-App-Deployment

## Description

Serverless-App-Deployment is a DevOps project aimed at simplifying the deployment of serverless applications using AWS technologies. The project leverages the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) for infrastructure as code and automates the deployment pipeline for seamless continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) of serverless applications.

### Key Features:

- **Multi-Cloud Deployment:** Deploy serverless applications across multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and GCP.
  
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Utilize AWS SAM for defining serverless infrastructure as code, making it scalable and version-controlled.
  
- **Continuous Deployment:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated and efficient deployment of serverless applications.

- **Tool Integration:** Utilize industry-standard tools such as Visual Studio Code, AWS CLI, and SAM CLI for local development, testing, and deployment.

### Tools Used:

- [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html): AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface for building, testing, and deploying serverless applications.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A lightweight and powerful code editor used for local development, debugging, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/): AWS Command Line Interface for interacting with AWS services from the command line.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/): Version control and repository management platform for collaborative development.

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): Optionally, for managing multi-cloud deployments and infrastructure.
